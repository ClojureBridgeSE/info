^I think that I shall never see
^A graph more lovely than a tree.
^A tree whose crucial property
^Is loop-free connectivity.
^A tree that must be sure to span
^So packets can reach every LAN.
^First, the root must be selected.
^By ID, it is elected.
^Least-cost paths from root are traced.
^In the tree, these paths are placed.
^A mesh is made by folks like me,
^Then bridges find a spanning tree.
^Algorhyme - Radia Perlman

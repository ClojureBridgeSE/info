> I think that I shall never see<br/>
> A graph more lovely than a tree.<br/>
> A tree whose crucial property<br/>
> Is loop-free connectivity.<br/>
> A tree that must be sure to span<br/>
> So packets can reach every LAN.<br/>
> First, the root must be selected.<br/>
> By ID, it is elected.<br/>
> Least-cost paths from root are traced.<br/>
> In the tree, these paths are placed.<br/>
> A mesh is made by folks like me,<br/>
> Then bridges find a spanning tree.<br/>

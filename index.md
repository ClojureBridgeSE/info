## Learning

Two of our wonderful sponsors, [PurelyFunctional.tv](https://purelyfunctional.tv/) and [Lambda Island](https://lambdaisland.com/), have provided a one year free membership to all ClojureBridge Stockholm participants and coaches!

* [PurelyFunctional.tv](https://purelyfunctional.tv/register/) - use the discount code we emailed to participants (contact us at ClojureBridgeSE@gmail.com if you can't find the code)
* [Lambda Island](https://lambdaisland.com/) - use the link we emailed to participants (contact us at ClojureBridgeSE@gmail.com if you can't find the link)

### Clojure for the Brave and True
Daniel Higginbotham didn't sponsor ClojureBridge Stockholm, he did one better by sponsoring all people who want to learn Clojure anywhere! Just visit [http://www.braveclojure.com/](http://www.braveclojure.com/), and you can read his wonderful book for free.

### Clojure exercises
* [Clojure Koans](http://clojurekoans.com/) - a very addictive way to learn. You add a tiny piece of missing code to make a test pass, then move onto the next.
* [Wonderland Clojure Katas](https://github.com/gigasquid/wonderland-clojure-katas) - a kata is a short exercise that helps you practise coding (just like a kata in martial arts, but with less kicking).
* [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/clojure/about) - slightly longer exercises with a social twist.
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/solve-me-first) - challenges to help you start coding in your favorite languages!
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/?language=clojure) -  where developers achieve code mastery through challenge.
* [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/all) - check out the courses on the command line and Github.
* [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) - a free course on the basics of git.

### Books
* [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/) - free!
* [Living Clojure](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1491909048) - by awesome Clojurian [Carin Meier](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/#/about/index), who uses Clojure to fly robots
